----------- Compiling the code
use the makefile 
it will generates a binary file

----------- Parameter for runnign the computation 

-d "dataset dimension"
-rd "range dimension"
-sw "list of slab-width values"  (it must be provided after -rd)
-bs "list of base values cutting the range values"      (if not provides, Slabs are computed with base 0)
-f  "list of input file names" (it must be provided after -rd)
-div "number of subdivisions for each dimension"  (if not provided, the computation does not use parallelism)
